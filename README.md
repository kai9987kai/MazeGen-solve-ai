# MazeGen-solve-ai

This script uses the tkinter module, which is a built-in module for creating graphical user interfaces, to generate a maze and display it in a canvas. The MazeGenerator class uses a depth-first search algorithm to generate the maze, and the MazeCanvas class extends the tkinter.Canvas class to draw the maze in a graphical format.

The script generates a maze of specified dimensions and displays it

after generating the maze, a Bot class is introduced to navigate through the maze. The bot moves randomly until it reaches the goal position. The bot's current position is visualized on the maze canvas as a red oval.
